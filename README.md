I'm hoping to make this into a scalable solution to a home automation with lots of the tools floating around built into one thing. And while this exist in things like Amazon Alexa, it doesn't offer very much customization for programmers. 

It's still in it's pre-alpha infancy so if you have any questions feel free to contact me here or at davidchristy520@gmail.com
